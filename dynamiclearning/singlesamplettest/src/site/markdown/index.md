## Introduction

This sample demonstrates the use of the TIBCO StreamBase&reg; Single Simple T-test operator. 

The provided StreamBase module uses the randomly generated data set including column Var1 and Var2. Var1 is generated with uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 100 with mean value = 50. Var2 is generated with uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 60 with mean 30. The data set is fed into the Matrix operator to collect and emit every 100 rows of data.
